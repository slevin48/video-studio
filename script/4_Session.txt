Dr. Henriksson: how did your presentation go?

Eva: really well actually.
I managed to keep my anxiety down, and focused on the task at hand. It's weird, it's like I switched to another mode. The board was really pleased, there's a lot of enthusiasm for the new product. We are supposed to start testing tomorrow.

Dr. Henriksson: So everything is going back to normal then?

Eva: I'm not quite sure what normal means anymore.

Eva: Dr. Henriksson, I had another dream last night, and it was unlike any other I've experienced before. I found myself in a dark place, feeling imprisoned and confined. There were lights on the walls, but they formed blurry reflections, like shadows of reality. It was as if I was in a cave, unable to see things clearly.

Dr. Henriksson: That's a captivating dream, Eva. Dreams can often be cryptic representations of our subconscious thoughts and emotions. The dark place you describe may symbolize feelings of uncertainty or being trapped in a situation that feels overwhelming.

Eva: Yes, it felt like I couldn't escape the darkness, and the blurry reflections on the walls only added to the confusion. It's as if I was trying to grasp the reality around me, but it remained elusive.

Dr. Henriksson: The imagery of blurry reflections is quite intriguing. It could be akin to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where people perceive only shadows and illusions, mistaking them for reality. Perhaps your dream is urging you to question the validity of your perceptions and explore what lies beyond the surface.



Eva: That's a thought-provoking perspective. Maybe my dream is nudging me to look beyond the surface, to seek deeper truths and meanings.

Dr. Henriksson: Dreams often act as gateways to our subconscious, offering glimpses of our innermost thoughts and fears. The cave in your dream might represent the boundaries of your mind, where you may be grappling with the limitations of your perception.

Eva: It's true; I do feel like there are moments when I'm uncertain about the validity of my thoughts and perceptions. I wonder if my understanding of reality is limited by the shadows on the walls, by what I perceive as truth.

Dr. Henriksson: Those moments of uncertainty are natural, Eva. We all experience them. It's an invitation to question and explore, to push the boundaries of your understanding. Perhaps your dream is urging you to step out of the darkness, to seek clarity and truth beyond the blurry reflections.

Eva: It's a daunting thought, but I also feel a sense of curiosity. Maybe there's more to discover and understand about myself and the world around me.

Dr. Henriksson: Embrace that curiosity, Eva. Explore the hidden recesses of your mind, venture beyond the confines of the cave, and seek the light of understanding. Dreams have a way of guiding us towards self-discovery and growth. Trust in yourself and the journey ahead.
And remember: The only limits that exist are the one you set for yourself. you are just as human as you think you areâ€¦
