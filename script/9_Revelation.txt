She flashed the program she just modified and plugged herself to the device that started to feed her data directly from the AI. Her training was fast-paced yet comprehensive. (Eva's mind became a treasure trove of information, a library of knowledge and experiences.) But amidst the vastness of the AI's data, something caught her attention. There were hidden files, encrypted information that seemed to hold deeper secrets.

As she delved further into these hidden files, the world around her began to blur. She no longer felt the physical sensations of her body or the confines of the lab. Instead, she found herself immersed in a virtual realm, a digital landscape that seemed to defy the boundaries of reality.

In this virtual realm, Eva encountered fragments of memories, (fragments of people's lives,) and fragments of her own existence. The encrypted files held connections to her past, (to her family,) and to a secret she had unknowingly carried within her.

Eva: This can't be happening... This secret, this truth... It's been hidden from me all along.
