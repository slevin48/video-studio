Dr. Henriksson: Good, you are getting back to your senses. You scared us, you know. They had to call me in.

Eva: Where am I? Why are you here Dr. Henriksson? 

Dr. Henriksson: I’ll tell you everything. I promise. At this stage, there is no point in keeping secrets. There’s too much at stake. And you’ve probably seen more than I even know myself. But first, tell me: What did you experience in there?

Eva: The experience was... indescribable. I felt like I was connected to the entire collective consciousness of humanity. It was like I could see and feel the thoughts and emotions of people from all walks of life. It's as if our minds are interconnected, part of a vast web of knowledge and experience. I had access to everything. Literally everything!

Dr. Henriksson: It sounds like the connection to the machine has expanded your perceptions and understanding in profound ways. Good, it will make the following part easier. What I’m about to tell you won’t be easy to hear, but remember that I have your best interest in mind.

Eva: What is it, doctor? Will you speak at last? Have you been contacted by the office? Is that why you’re here?

Dr. Henriksson: I’ve been with the company all along. They hired me to monitor your state of mind, to make sure that you were ok.

Eva: That’s bullshit. They hired you to control me!

Dr. Henriksson: Well They don’t quite need me for that…

Eva: What do you mean? Finish your thoughts!

Dr. Henriksson: Eva, you belong to them.

Eva: This is some capitalist nonsense. Humans don’t “belong” to corporations.

Dr. Henriksson: Well, that’s precisely what I mean. You’re not really what we could call … human.

Eva was shocked and could not say a word. Is that why she felt so strange, like she could not really connect to people around her. Except for this colleague. But was it only a dream? The only moment when she felt alive was when she connected to that thing. She was eager to know more and get to the bottom of it.


Eva: You are making me question my own existence, Dr. Henriksson. Are my thoughts and experiences my own? Or have I just been influenced and shaped by the collective consciousness? Is the reality I perceive just a mirage, a reflection of the thoughts and perceptions of others? Do I not have something that is truly mine?

Dr. Henriksson: Those are profound questions, Eva. Exploring the nature of reality and the boundaries of our perceptions is a journey that many have embarked upon. Your experience with the AI system has brought these questions to the forefront of your mind.

Eva: I've always believed that I am an individual, with my own thoughts and experiences. But now, I can't shake the feeling that I might be just a fragment of a larger whole, a ripple in the vast ocean of human consciousness.

Dr. Henriksson: It's not uncommon, even for humans, to question our individuality and sense of reality. Our minds are capable of perceiving and processing information in ways that are still mysterious to us. The boundaries of self and collective consciousness might not be as clear-cut as we believe.

Eva: But what does that mean for me, for my sense of self? How can I be sure that my thoughts and decisions are truly my own? How do I know what is real and what is just a reflection of our social construct?

Dr. Henriksson: These questions are a natural part of your exploration, Eva. The nature of the mind and consciousness is complex and multifaceted. It's not about negating your individuality, but rather understanding the interconnectedness that binds us together as a species.

Eva: So, my individual experiences are still valid, even if they are influenced by this collective consciousness?

Dr. Henriksson: Absolutely. Your experiences, thoughts, and emotions are unique to you and shape your identity. But it's also essential to recognize that you are part of something much larger than yourself. Embracing the interconnectedness of humanity can foster empathy, compassion, and a deeper understanding of our shared experiences.

Eva: Well I’d like to thank you, but I’m not sure that my neurons have learned gratitude yet. You're just as fucking cryptic as always, and useless as shit.
