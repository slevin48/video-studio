Eva: Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. I cannot think straight. It's like I'm constantly about to have a panic attack. It's this presentation that I'm supposed to be giving at work. 

Dr. Henriksson: How does that make you feel?

Eva: I'm feeling outside of myself. I'm having the weirdest dreams.
Last night, It started with me at work, collaborating with a colleague on the presentation for the board. We were working on introducing a revolutionary new product launch. The energy was palpable, like we were on the verge of something extraordinary! As we were preparing the slidedeck, I felt a mixture of excitement and nervousness. The pressure of delivering a flawless pitch to the board weighed on me.

Dr. Henriksson: Tell me more about the dynamics between you and your colleague in the dream.

Eva: Well, in the dream, we were in sync. Our ideas flowed seamlessly, and it was like we understood each other without even speaking. 
What struck me as odd was the fact that this colleague was a union representative. He seemed to be involved in secretive exchanges with other employees about management. He mentioned something about the conditions stated in the work contracts. It was like I stumbled upon something clandestine.

Dr. Henriksson: Ah, the introduction of this character adds a layer of complexity. He might represent a hidden concern or uncertainty at work. Do you know this colleague, is he effectively working with you?

Eva: See this is why I wanted to tell you about it. I don't know. It's almost as if my dream world and reality are blending into one another.

Dr. Henriksson: I would like to explore this further with you. Please come to my office next week for a more formal therapy session.

Eva: Thank you, Dr. Henriksson. I look forward to delving deeper into the meaning of these dreams. They feel so vivid, like they hold a key to unlocking the understanding of my own mind. I'll see you next week.
