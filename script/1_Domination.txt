This city is broken. The less fortunate are all hustling for petty money, ending up in washing the dirty laundry of the Mafia of the rich and the  politicians. 

What happened to all of this excitement? The promises of new tech in all aspects of society? 

Elon Musk becoming the president was supposed to get rid of the old politics. And he did. But what he brought instead is arguably much worse. Obviously some were satisfied with this new state of play. Libertarianism at his extreme. Darwin wins. The strong exploit the weak, and become even more rich in doing so.

I need to escape this system. But there's no way out. Maybe he'll be able to help me. I feel stuck with myself. None of this feels real anymore.
