It's like I got shot in the back.
I’m not quite sure who pulled the trigger. 
But just like that the old me was dead. It’s a shame, I kinda liked him. But he was an arrogant prick. He knew too much. 
So maybe it is for the best. I want no memory of him.

Maybe the new me won't be such a fucking moron. I need a fresh start. A new life. Rebirth in the skin of a stoic. Baptized in my own blood.

It's best to forget. This reality is of no use.
This city is rotten. Flooded with bad blood.
Politicians selling our freedom to the highest bidder. And corporations growing in influence and greed without any form of regulation.
This city is doomed.
